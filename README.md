# vanilla-js-ui-components

This is my personal collection of UI components implemented with vanilla JavaScript

I created them so I can refresh my knowledge and skills with DOM API and vanilla JS

This repo is connected with Netlify and you can see up-to-date live demo [here](https://gallant-rosalind-e1ab85.netlify.app/)

Please note, that these components are not production ready, they are just demos for learning
